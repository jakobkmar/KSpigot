# KSpigot

KSpigot extends Spigot (and all of its forks) with additional functionality. This reaches from small extension functions, to features making use of Kotlin's language features and finally to bigger APIs (e.g. the GUI API).

KSpigot is [at home on GitHub](https://github.com/bluefireoly/KSpigot). Feel free to contribute to the project.
