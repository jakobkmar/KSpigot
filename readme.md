KSpigot is a Kotlin library for the popular [spigot server software](https://spigotmc.org/) for minecraft. It adds
lots of useful features, builders and extensions for the Spigot API itself - but KSpigot also brings new things like an
Inventory GUI API, or Brigardier support.

## Dependency

KSpigot is available on Maven Central.

Gradle:

```kt
implementation("net.axay:kspigot:$kspigotVersion")
```

## Old tutorials

The following content consist of some features which haven't already been migrated to the new
[guide](https://bluefireoly.github.io/KSpigot/).

### Chainable runnables

This makes it possible to do resource intensive tasks asynchronous and then doing something with the result
synchronous (e.g. because Spigot forces you) in a simple way.

```kotlin
firstAsync {
    // do a resource intensive task
    ArrayList<Block>() // -> this will be forwarded to the next part of the chain as "it"
}.thenSync {
    // do something with the result
    it.forEach { }
}.thenAsync {
    // and so on...
}.execute()
```

### Inventory GUI API

Inventories are great for viewing GUI information. However, they are not designed for developing GUIs. The KSpigot
Inventory GUI API provides an easy way to build inventory GUIs the way you would expect such an API to be. In addition,
it offers full type safety for slots.

```kotlin
val gui = kSpigotGUI(GUIType.FIVE_BY_NINE) {
    title = "Example Inventory"

    page(0) {
        // slot ranges like rectTo or linTo reduce the amount of code
        placeholder(Slots.RowOneSlotOne rectTo Slots.RowFiveSlotNine, ItemStack(Material.RED_STAINED_GLASS))
        nextPage(Slots.RowOneSlotNine, ItemStack(Material.PAPER))
    }

    page(1) {
        // define fancy transitions
        transitionFrom = PageChangeEffect.SLIDE_HORIZONTALLY
        transitionTo = PageChangeEffect.SLIDE_HORIZONTALLY

        // get special slot compounds easily with constants like Slots.Border
        placeholder(Slots.Border, ItemStack(Material.GLASS_PANE))

        // page change buttons
        previousPage(Slots.RowTwoSlotTwo, ItemStack(Material.PAPER))
        nextPage(Slots.RowTwoSlotEight, ItemStack(Material.PAPER))

        // a button with a custom callback
        button(Slots.RowThreeSlotFive, ItemStack(Material.REPEATER)) {
            // change content of the current view
            it.guiInstance[Slots.RowTwoSlotFive] = ItemStack(Material.values().random(), (1..64).random())
        }

        // a slot where player interaction is permitted
        freeSlot(Slots.RowTwoSlotFive)
    }

    page(2) {
        // placeholders are there to block any player action while displaying a specific item
        placeholder(Slots.RowOneSlotOne rectTo Slots.RowFiveSlotNine, ItemStack(Material.PINK_GLAZED_TERRACOTTA))

        // change to a specific page
        pageChanger(Slots.RowThreeSlotFive, ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND), 1)
    }
}
```

This example: _This inventory has three pages. On page 1, there is a button for generating random ItemStacks. The player
can take out this ItemStack and move it to his own inventory._

Then you can open the GUI for any player.

```kotlin
player.openGUI(gui)
```

### Complex chat components

**DEPRECATED** Use `literalText` instead. More info will be available in the guide soon.

Creating chat components can get very messy quickly. However, creating a component with KSpigot is much more
developer-friendly.

```kotlin
val component = chatComponent {
    text("You got a friend request! ") {
        color = col("#4FEA40")
        isBold = true
    }

    text("[Accept]") {
        color = ChatColor.WHITE
        clickEvent(ClickEvent.Action.RUN_COMMAND, "friend accept Foo")
        hoverEventText {
            text("Click here to accept the friend request!") { color = ChatColor.RED }
        }
    }
}
```

You can also access the builder and immediately send the message.

```kotlin
commandSender.sendMessage { /* same in here as above */ }
```

### Firework API

Tutorial still missing, both here and in the guide

### NBTData support

Typesafe and consistent

```kotlin
// load nbt
val nbt = entity.nbtData

// retrieve data via keys
val health = nbt["hearts", NBTDataType.INT]

// set data for a given key
nbt["custom", NBTDataType.DOUBLE] = 3.3

// delete data for a given key
nbt -= "keyToDelete"

// save data to the entity
entity.nbtData = nbt

// serialization support
val serializedString = nbt.serialize()
val deserializeMethod1 = NBTData(serializedString)
val deserializeMethod2 = NBTData.deserialize(serializedString)
```

### Simple extension functions and values

```kotlin
livingEntity.isInWater // checks if both feet and head are in water
livingEntity.isHeadInWater // checks if the head (eye location) is in water
entity.isFeetInWater // checks if the feet are in water
entity.isGroundSolid // checks if the entity stands on solid material
damageable.kill() // instantly kills the damageable
livingEntity.heal() // sets the health to the maximum health (if given - else throws Exception)
player.feed() // sets the players food level to 20
player.saturate() // sets the players saturation level to the current max value
player.feedSaturate() // sets the players food and saturation level to 20
player.disappear(plugin) // all other players won't be able to see the player anymore
player.appear(plugin) // show the player to every other player
vector.isFinite // checks if x, y and z of the vector are all finite
playerInteractEntityEvent.interactItem // gets the item the player interacted with
prepareItemCraftEvent.isCancelled // checks if the event isCancelled
prepareItemCraftEvent.cancel() // cancels the PrepareItemCraftEvent
```

### Direction API

Handles the hassle of struggling with direction angles for you.

```kotlin
val cardinal = CardinalDirection.fromLocation(loc) // NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST
val vertical = VerticalDirection.fromLocation(loc) // UP, DOWN, STRAIGHT

// convert to BlockFace
val blockFace = cardinal.facing
```

### CustomItemIdentifiers

You want to mess with resourcepacks and extend your possibilities? <br>
Spigot is lacking a representation of custom items (via custom model data). This is what the data
class `CustomItemIdentifier` is for.

```kotlin
val identifier = CustomItemIdentifier(itemStack)
// or
val identifier = CustomItemIdentifier(1001, Material.IRON_NUGGET)

// get an itemstack with the custom model data applied
val stack = identifier.itemStack
```

### Flexible and chainable geometry syntax

Makes complex modification of locations and vectors more intuitive. Also, you can use any type of number (`Short`, `Int`
, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`) you want. You do not have to mess with different data types.

```kotlin
loc increaseX 3 reduce vec(3.0, 1.5f, 3) increaseYZ 5.7
loc + vecXY(3, 7f) - vecZ(3)
loc - vec(x = 3, z = 5.6f) * 3 * vecXZ(7, 3.1)
```

### Structures

A structure is a set of data defining what is inside a specific area.

#### LocationArea

A LocationArea is an area between to given Locations. The max and min locations will be calculated automatically.

```kotlin
val area = LocationArea(loc1, loc2) // loc1 and loc2 do not have to be min and max
area.minLoc
area.maxLoc
area.touchedChunks // get all chunks the LocationArea "lays" in
area.isInArea(loc3, check3d = true, tolerance = 0)

area.fillBlocks.forEach { /* execute task for each block in the area*/ }
area.entities.forEach { /* execute task for each entity in the area*/ }
```

#### Loading a structure

A structure can be loaded from any given LocationArea:

```kotlin
val structure = area.loadStructure(includeBlocks = true, includeEntities = false)
```

#### Using a structure

Structures can be transformed and placed in the world.

```kotlin
// rotate the structure (angle in degrees)
structure.rotateAroundX(angle)
structure.rotateAroundY(angle)
structure.rotateAroundZ(angle)

// place the structure at the given location
structure.buildAt(loc)
```

#### Default structures

##### Circle

There are different circle types, all inheriting from `Circle`.

```kotlin
val circle = MaterialCircle(radius, Material.GRASS_BLOCK)
val circle = ParticleCircle(radius, particle(Particle.HEART) { amount = 5 })
val circle = EntityCircle(radius, EntityType.COW)
```

A circle can be filled, or it can only consist of its border (edge).

```kotlin
// get all circle locations
circle.fillLocations
circle.edgeLocations

// get a structure from the circle
circle.filledStructure
circle.edgeStructure
```

### IP Address API

This API allows you to easily get some data from the IP address of a player. Please note that it is not promised that
this always returns data: _After exceeding a certain amount of request per minute, the request will return null._

```kotlin
player.ipAddressData
// or (for results in another language)
player.ipAddressData(IPAddressDataLanguage.GERMAN)
```

What kind of data is available?

```kotlin
ipData ?: return

ipData.district
ipData.city
ipData.continent
ipData.country
// and more...
```

### Particles

This part of the API makes it more intuitive to deal with particles.

```kotlin
// define the particle
val particle = particle(Particle.BLOCK_CRACK) {
    amount = 10
    offset = vec(3, 3, 3)
    extra = 0.1
    force = true
}

// spawn the particle
particle.spawnAt(loc)
particle.spawnFor(player)
```

You can also access the builder as follows (and instantly spawn the particle).

```kotlin
loc.particle(Particle.HEART) { }
player.particle(Particle.HEART) { }
```

### GamePhase API

Game phases are commonly used with minigames. This is why KSpigot provides a general way to create such a game phase
system quickly.

```kotlin
val game = buildGame {
    phase(length) {
        counterMessage("The game will start in", "seconds", "second", ">>", ".")

        end {
            broadcast("The game has started.")
        }
    }

    phase(length) {
        // alternative counterMessage implementation
        counterMessage {
            ">> The special event will start in $it seconds."
        }

        start { /* do something in the beginning of the gamephase */ }
        end { /* e.g. start the event */ }
    }
}

game.begin()
```

Idle phases are still in development.
